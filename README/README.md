# Console-Finances
A JS evaluation of finances

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- We wanted to achieve a Javascript system that is capable of traking finances
- this was created to shorten the time it would take to calculate the results without computer assistance
- During this process I learnt more about the for loop, arrays and the use of push to add to arrays.
